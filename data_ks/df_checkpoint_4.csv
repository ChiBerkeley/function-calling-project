500 miles is approximately 805 kilometers. 
Fuel efficiency of 19 km/l is equivalent to 4.97 miles/gallon. 
Fuel cost of $2 per liter is equivalent to $2.33 per gallon. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost: 
Total cost = (distance in miles / fuel efficiency in miles/gallon) * fuel cost in dollars per gallon 
Total cost = (500 / 4.97) * 2.33 
Total cost ≈ 233.49
